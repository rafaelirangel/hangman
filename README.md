## Game Explanation
Hangman is a word guessing game in which players try to guess a word by guessing letters. The game typically starts with a blank word, and the player tries to guess letters that might be in the word. For each letter that the player guesses incorrectly, a part of a stick figure is drawn, representing a person being "hanged." The player has a limited number of chances(in this case the number of chances are 6) to guess the word before the 'person' is fully drawn and the game is lost.

## How to Play
Use the keyboard provided on the screen to guess a letter in the secret word. If you guess correctly, the letter will appear onscreen. If your guess is incorrect, parts of the hangman body will start to be drawing. Fill in the blanks before the whole hangman is drawn and you score a point.
Press 'Play' to have a random word chosen for you.

+ JavaScript

## Challenges
Drawing the hangman structure and body was challenging, I did a lot of reesearch and decided to use canvas(the canvas element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that displays graphics by using a canvas context. The context provides a set of drawing functions, such as fillRect(), strokeRect(), clearRect(), drawImage(), etc., that can be used to draw shapes, lines, and images on the canvas.)  
Reseting the game was also hard for me (I'm still working on it because its not working how it should be).

## Next Steps
I would like to allow the user to enter their own word, choose from several themes and to select a level of difficulty that would pull random words from different lists.
I would like to make my code more proficient and add more style to it
